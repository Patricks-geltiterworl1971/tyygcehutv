Just walked out of The Electric State and wow, my head's still spinning like I’m caught in a dishwasher. The theater was too loud, I couldn't hear my own thoughts, but the   somehow still whispers in my brain — a mix of static and melancholy. Seriously, if popcorn kernels were memories, they’d be spilling all over my mind right now.

So there’s this girl and her robot, a misfit pair like peanut butter and hammers, trekking across this dead America landscape that feels like it was dreamed up if a napping dog suddenly became aware of existential dread. The visuals, like, you could feel the grit on your eyeballs. Why do I remember the sky looking like the inside of an old TV? Everything buzzing with this electric loneliness, almost tasting the neon blues on your teeth.

> Some guy two rows back kept coughing and I think he sneezed when everything went silent right before that scene with all those — were they holograms? They were shimmering, like ghosts or forgotten apps running in the background of a dying computer. And the music — like a lullaby sung by a refrigerator, haunting yet somehow comforting? Spooky cool.

The characters spoke like they knew something I didn’t — like the secrets of the universe were stored in a backup file I couldn't access. Maybe like trying to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 The Electric State with less than 5% battery left. There’s so much to unpack I need a suitcase made of caffeine and sticky notes. And the robot, that loyal hunk of metal — man, it was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a toaster get philosophical.

Oh, and her brother — or was that actually just another facet of her own imagination? I need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, maybe my dreams will have better 𝘴𝘶𝘣𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘭𝘦s next time. There were moments that felt like a lullaby, but sung by the nights we try to forget — does that even make sense, outside of my head?

Now caught with popcorn crumbs down my shirt, which isn’t too unpleasant, 'cause it kind of matches the feeling of the   — pieces left behind, making you slightly uncomfortable but weirdly warm.

𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you can survive without blinking for too long. My back aches from sitting still so long, feels like I’ve been unplugged from the matrix but forgot how to stand up straight. 

And here, some leftover code I was playing with in another tab, completely unrelated to my scrambled thoughts:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define CHAOS_THEORY

int main() {
    printf(electric dreamscape
);
    return 0;
}
